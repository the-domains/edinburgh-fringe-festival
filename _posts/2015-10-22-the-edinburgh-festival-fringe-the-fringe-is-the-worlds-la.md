The Edinburgh Festival Fringe (The Fringe) is the world's largest arts festival, with the 2014 event spanning 25 days and featuring over 3,193 shows from 51 countries in 299 venues.\[1\] Established in 1947 as an alternative to the Edinburgh International Festival, it takes place annually in Scotland's capital, in the month of August.\[2\] The Fringe is a showcase for the performing arts, with show categories including Cabaret, Children's shows, Comedy, Dance, Physical Theatre & Circus, Events, Exhibitions, Music, Musicals and Opera, Spoken Word and Theatre. In addition to ticketed, programmed events, the Fringe Street Events hosted by Virgin Money run each day of the festival, primarily on the Royal Mile and at the Mound Precinct. This is the largest street fair of its kind in the world, and in 2014 saw 933 groups participate.
